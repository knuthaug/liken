Liken 
==================================================

  lik·en  (lkn)
    tr.v. lik·ened, lik·en·ing, lik·ens
    To see, mention, or show as similar; compare.

The plan is to make Liken a tool for automatically comparing stuff (on
the web) through screen scraping. The particular itch I am trying to
scratch with Liken is to get a tool that will automatically monitor
web pages and specifically the version number of software hosted on
those web pages and give me a little notification when it changes when
compared to the baseline value or the previous value.

Oh, and learn git, github and ruby in the process. 

We'll see how that goes.
